# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 2e8b314f39623d578ec6653792005ade
- SHA256: dbd9e77e429d375014982a5397469c580f73197ebd44586230713714a9e3ba2f

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
