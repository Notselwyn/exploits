# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 5912214a43374ca97fa15051f5c6792f
- SHA256: 453c8f567c93c3f5812a5825c963aafa6391380228c273cdfc5d2f3793de6b09

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
