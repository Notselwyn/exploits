# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 9a22e9c5c625ddde9f912a67608427f8
- SHA256: 8401678e12d032726f76f98a6dc64408cf7e1530719ef25fd1449dae88182f85

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit before it was public. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
