# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 466167dee246a4004d0570b45ed2e5eb
- SHA256: 09bbcb951aa79dac79a9ea2dae58e68f26ad5c00e022f01c6abcb7e24f0756c4

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
