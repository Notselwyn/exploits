# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: b5a2a80d451ad3b2320bdc9813b399f9
- SHA256: e296ada4333eddeb97202a1a72a466edc816b3a98ebce0d9309edd7b57b27978

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
