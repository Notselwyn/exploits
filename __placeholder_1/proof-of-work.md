# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 5dda45276844df2017c2f7169437db32
- SHA256: e5fb7eaa42991e7ba1808524aca656ce6b9f33cadfa9fa50eeb2a0a0ba317135 

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit before it was public. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running md5sum or sha256sum.
