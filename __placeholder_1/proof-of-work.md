# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 1cb59455021fddae1df1caff1c0201ec
- SHA256: 64c5f46cf9065f32e82c2846495d8ca7af5f81a39ecfbc315cbe3809e06b2b7a

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit before it was public. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
