# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 5204b2a45e440f062e84153d91f0ed24
- SHA256: f33e7d972e8eb426f9175659e7bdd730f18e73eaaa1a2102c3cb3873adbe5afe 

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit before it was public. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running md5sum or sha256sum.
