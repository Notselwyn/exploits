# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: e08fd02275f6c4e7e9224846f0481649
- SHA256: a66ed8f2e537d28511862c84f1ff9c9660bbd1d2be25aeca5e571cbcb24c2b92

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit before it was public. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
