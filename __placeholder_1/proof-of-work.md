# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 23853328302cce66ea237be475acd3b5
- SHA256: e37e457d85eada81ee3e867858ff326847bf116257a1cc95d5d02fb1ec2acb6a

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
