# Proof of Work (PoW)
## Hash
- MD5: 0c4425e267b11077590fcb951f7f5eb8
- SHA256: 03d5f0c65f1e9ca23fe742fca78a28777d4133c99ee1e2b0a2bea10fcab374ba

## Why a PoW?
I do this to prove I made the exploit and found the vulnerability before it was disclosed. You can verify it by inspecting the commit time on Github and git, and running `md5sum` or `sha256sum`.
